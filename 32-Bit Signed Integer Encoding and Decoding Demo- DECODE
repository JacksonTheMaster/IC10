# Decoding Script: Decode the combined number

# Load the combined number (from the encoding script or elsewhere)
move r2 COMBINED_NUMBER   # Replace COMBINED_NUMBER with the actual combined value

### Decoding the combined number

# Retrieve NUMBER1 from the combined value
srl r3 r2 16            # Shift right by 16 bits to get the original NUMBER1
s db Setting r3         # Output the decoded NUMBER1
sleep 2

# Retrieve NUMBER2 from the combined value
and r4 r2 65535         # Mask the lower 16 bits to get NUMBER2
s db Setting r4         # Output the decoded NUMBER2
sleep 2
