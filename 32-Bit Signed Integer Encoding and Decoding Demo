### Combining NUMBER1 and NUMBER2

# Load the first number (NUMBER1)
move r0 NUMBER1         # Load NUMBER1 into r0

# Shift NUMBER1 to the left to make room for NUMBER2
sll r0 r0 16            # Shift NUMBER1 left by 16 bits

# Load the second number (NUMBER2)
move r1 NUMBER2         # Load NUMBER2 into r1

# Combine the two numbers by adding them together
add r0 r0 r1            # r0 now contains the combined number

# Store the combined result in r2 for decoding later
move r2 r0              # Store the combined number in r2
s db Setting r2         # Output the combined number for debugging
sleep 2

### Decoding the combined number

# Retrieve NUMBER1 from the combined value
srl r3 r2 16            # Shift right by 16 bits to get the original NUMBER1
s db Setting r3         # Output the decoded NUMBER1
sleep 2

# Retrieve NUMBER2 from the combined value
and r4 r2 65535         # Mask the lower 16 bits to get NUMBER2
s db Setting r4         # Output the decoded NUMBER2
sleep 2

j main                  # Loop back to main
